    "Welcome!  The goal of these tutorials is to help you get familiar with basic aspects of Python that will allow you to be more productive in everyday work.  We will work on skills that will let you graph, manipulate, and manage data.  Our goal will be to take things one step at a time, learning only what is needed to accomplish a specific task.  The philosophy behind these tutorials is learning by doing, rather than learning to let you do something later.  Hopefully you will start learning tools right from day one that will be useful in other settings.  By the end of these tutorials, you will be able to make complicated applications that load and save data to and from files, manipulate data, run numerical simulations, make complex visualizations and more!

    "## Tutorial 5: For Loops\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will introduce the concept of loops as a means for repeating an action.  Loops are very useful in many situations, in particular they can be helpful for reading and writing data files or repeating a complex set of procedures multiple times.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial you will be able to automate the process of adding multiple datasets to a graph. \n",
    "\n",
    "<U>In this tutorial we will cover:</u>\n",
    "- What are loops?\n",
    "- Using a counter in a loop.\n",
    "- Using loops with Numpy arrays.\n",
    "- Plotting multiple data sets with a for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: What are loops?\n",
    "Loops are a basic part of every programming language.  They let you repeat an action that would otherwise be repetitive.  For example, imagine that you were performing an analysis of a remote sensing image that required you to count how many pixels in the image were urbanized versus agricultural or forested areas.  You could use a loop to allow you to: (i) visit a pixel in the image, (ii) make a determination of the landuse at that pixel, (iii) record the result, and (iv) move to the next pixel in the image.  By repeating these four commands, it would be possible to visit and classify every pixel in the image.    \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two different ways that this loop could be done.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You could say:  \n",
    "\n",
    "><b>while</b> <i>you have not yet visited every pixel in the image</i>\n",
    "1. choose a pixel that has not yet been classified  \n",
    "2. classify the land use for that pixel  \n",
    "3. record the result in an array  \n",
    "4. repeat  \n",
    "\n",
    "Or you could alternatively say:\n",
    "\n",
    "><b>for</b> <i>pixel 1 to pixel N (where N is the last pixel in the image)</i>\n",
    "1. go to the next pixel in a list of pixels\n",
    "2. classify the land use for that pixel\n",
    "3. record the result in an array\n",
    "4. stop after you classify pixel N\n",
    "\n",
    "While these seem pretty similar, in the first case you don't need to know how many pixels are in the image.  Instead, the desired actions continue being repeated *while* there are still pixels that have yet to be classified.  In contrast, you need to specify all the pixels in the image from the beginning in the second case.  Thus these two cases represent two fundamentally different ways of constructing loops: <b>while loops</b> and <b>for loops</b>.  In this tutorial, we will focus on *for loops*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### for loop  \n",
    "*For loops are used to repeat an action <b>for</b> a fixed number of values.  In Python, for loops progress through a sequence of values provided in a list until the loop has been repeated for each value in the list.  This is a little different from other languages where the loop is controlled by a counter that increments during each iteration.*\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Structure of a For Loop</u>  \n",
    "To create a for loop you use the keyword <b>`for`</b> followed by: a variable that will be used as a *`counter`*, the keyword <b>`in`</b>, the *`list`* used for iterating, and a colon (<b>:</b>).  The comands that are to be repeated follow the first line as indented code.  It is important to indent the lines below the first one so that Python knows what actions are to be repeated.  \n",
    "\n",
    "><b>for</b> <i>counter</i> <b>in</b> <i>list</i>:  \n",
    "    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*commands to be repeated*  (one command per line, must be indented)\n",
    "\n",
    "As the loop progresses, the counter variable will take on a new value from the list after each iteration.\n",

There is no advance check to make sure that the loop makes sense for all of values of the list you used to create it.  For example, in our problem above you saw that the output was printed for the first four iterations of the loop and an error didn't occur until the fifth time through the loop.  This can sometimes make it hard to find problems in the code if you are just using a small subset of data to test it.\n",
    "2. Always remember to be thinking about what the value of the counter is when you are referencing index positions in an array or list.  This become increasingly complicated (and confusing) when you go to higher array dimensions (e.g., a data table or 3D volume of data).    \n",
    "3. It is a good idea to always use arrays (or lists) that have the same size of data if your intent is to loop through all values.  There are cases, however, where this might now apply (e.g., if you are referencing values from a large data set)."

    "#### Flight of the Bumblebee!\n",
    "Here is an example of a problem where you can't use arrays: the path that a bee takes during a flight!  Well, I don't know if this is actually how bees fly, but we will approximate their motion using Brownian motion, where the direction they move in has a random component to it.  We can do a simply array calculation because where they are going next depends on where they have been and since their path is random, there is no way to predict it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, let's try to estimate where the bee is located at 100 different points in time.  Here is a simple model for the bee's flight path:  \n",
    "> position now = position at previous time + average velocity time lenght of time bewteen updates + random perturbation in flight path\n",
    " \n",
    " We could write this a little more mathematically as:\n",
    " > $x(t_{i}) = x(t_{i-1}) + v_x*{\\Delta}t + \\delta_{x}$\n",
    " \n",
    " where:  \n",
    " $x(t_i)$ = the bee's position at the curren observation time $t_i$  \n",
    " $x(t_{i-1})$ = the bee's position at the previous observation point $t_{i-1}$  \n",
    " $v_x$ = the average velocity of the bee in the x direction  \n",
    " ${\\Delta}t = t_i - t_{i-1}$ = the length of time between the observation periods\n",
    " $\\delta_x$ = a perturbation in position along the average flight path due to random effects (e.g., wind, pretty flowers, etc)\n",
    " \n",
    "One last thing that we will need is to decide how big to make the deviations from the bee's flight path.  Because these are random deviations, we will use a number random generator, i.e., `np.random.normal()`.  Since this isn't a statistics or biology tutorial, we'll just use a Guassian random number generator for this example, because it can create both positive and negative numbers that follow a bell curve (normal distribution) with a mean of zero and standard deviation of 1.  We will use a parameter (`drift`) to specify how large the deviations of the bee are compared to the average distance the bee travels during a time period between observations.  Thus we will have:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $\\delta_x = drift*rnd$   (where *rnd* is a random number drawn using the np.random.normal() function)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So our final formula for the flight path of the bee in the x-direction is:  \n",
    " > $x(t_{i}) = x(t_{i-1}) + v_x*{\\Delta}t + drift*rnd$\n",
    "\n",
    "To make things extra interesting, let's use the same type of formula for the bee's position in the y direction.  In this case, everything would be the same, but replace the x's with y's in the formula.\n",
    " > $y(t_{i}) = y(t_{i-1}) + v_y*{\\Delta}t + drift*rnd$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " These two equations can be used to update the position of the bee over time - a loop is perfect for this!  But we need to know where the bee is at time $t_{i-1}$ to predict where it will go at time $t_i$.  So we will have to pick a starting position for the bee before we can start calculating step by step where the bee is going using a loop.  In addition, we need to know the average velocity of the bee in the x and y directions.  \n",
    " \n",
    "One last issue is that if we want to use a loop to update the position of the bee over time, we need to initialize the array that will hold these positions first just like we did for the loop counter we made earlier, i.e., we can't update something that doesn't yet exist.\n",
    " \n",
    " So before we start coding, let's map out in words what we need to do to solve this problem:\n",
    " 1. assign the parameters needed for the bee flight model ($v_x, v_y, {\\Delta}t$, and *drift*) \n",
    " 2. assign the initial position of the bee ($x_o$ and $y_o$)\n",
    " 3. define the number of steps through time for which we will observe the bee\n",
    " 4. initialize an array to store the position results\n",
    " 5. for each time step, calculate the new position of the bee from the old position\n",
    " 6. repeat until the bee's position has been calculated for all time steps\n",
