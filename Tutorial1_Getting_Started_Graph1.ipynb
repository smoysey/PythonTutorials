    "Welcome!  The goal of these tutorials is to help you get familiar with basic aspects of Python that will allow you to be more productive in everyday work.  We will work on skills that will let you graph, manipulate, and manage data.  Our goal will be to take things one step at a time, learning only what is needed to accomplish a specific task.  The philosophy behind these tutorials is learning by doing, rather than learning to let you do something later.  Hopefully you will start learning tools right from day one that will be useful in other settings.  By the end of these tutorials, you will be able to make complicated applications that load and save data to and from files, manipulate data, run numerical simulations, make complex visualizations and more!

    "* `pylab` - loads a special set of modules with tools you will want to use (e.g., NumPy and matplotlib)\n",
    "* [... , ... , ... ] - use square brackets to create a list of objects, such as numbers or text strings\n",

    "Congratulations!  If you are reading this, you have already opened a Jupyter notebook.  While Python can be run in a lot of different ways, we are going to start here using notebooks to make things easier and allow us to go step by step.  Later on we will try running Python using some other interfaces or directly from your computer's command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, Jupyter notebooks run in your web browser.  You may have noticed that a console window may have also opened when you started Jupyter.  This is actually a little server running on your computer that does the interfacing between what you type here and the Python interpreter on your computer (i.e., the thing that actually does the work).  \n",
    "\n",
    "As we move through this tutorial, you will see cells like this that are filled with text and other cells that contain Python code that will be run.  The boxes filled with text are called _markdown_ cells and are used to communicate information.  You can use special codes in markdown boxes to format the text however you like.  You can learn more about the special codes used for formatting [at this website](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).  Our goal right now, however, is to learn to code and not to write in a Jupyter notebook, so don't worry too much about that.  \n",

Extra functionality, such as functions for handling numbers in certain ways or making graphs, have to be loaded in seperately as _modules_.  We'll talk more about this later, but for now all that you need to know is that sometimes you will see that I have already added some commands to load a module in a code cell.  You don't need to alter these.  There is a special command that will actually automatically load a whole bunch of modules we might want to use for scientific computing.  This command is `pylab`.  Go ahead and type this in the cell below and then run the cell.   "

We need a way to tell Python that we want to group a set of values, such as our observations, together as one set of numbers.  One way of doing this is called a _list_, which is really just a set of things you want to group together.
