    "Welcome!  The goal of these tutorials is to help you get familiar with basic aspects of Python that will allow you to be more productive in everyday work.  We will work on skills that will let you graph, manipulate, and manage data.  Our goal will be to take things one step at a time, learning only what is needed to accomplish a specific task.  The philosophy behind these tutorials is learning by doing, rather than learning to let you do something later.  Hopefully you will start learning tools right from day one that will be useful in other settings.  By the end of these tutorials, you will be able to make complicated applications that load and save data to and from files, manipulate data, run numerical simulations, make complex visualizations and more! \n",

In __Part 2__ of the tutorial, you will learn how to create your own functions.\n",

    "- line 2 to N-1: commands that the function will complete, including definition of variables, calculations, plotting, etc.\n",
    "- line N: __return__ keyword followed by a list of output arguements for the function. \n",
    "</i>\n",
    "\n",
    "While only line 1 is required to create a function, it doesn't really make sense to make a function if it doesn't actually do anything, so you should expect to have at least a few additional lines of code in your function.  Line N is required if your function will return a result.  In this case, you *must* create and use this variable in your function (i.e., on lines 2 to N-1).  In most cases, only variables that follow the __return__ keyword will be output by the function.  Any other variables you have created to store calculations or data within the function will be destroyed and lost from the computer's member once the function ends.\n",

    "In this case we didn't get an error.  Though let's dive in to understand what happened.  By making x a global variable, it no longer exists only within the scope of the function.  In other words, the function can read and write to the x variable that exists in the main workspace.  So now when the function runs, the first `print(x)` statement reads the pre-existing value of x in the main workspace.  The line `x = 'updated x'` overwrites the value of x in the main workspace.  The second `print(x)` command in the function again prints the value of x from the main workspace, but this has now been updated to be the text *updated x*.  Finally, after the function is finished running, we use the `print(x)` command outside of the function and we can see that even though the function is long gone, the value of x is still the updated value we set inside of the function.\n",

    "While the use of global variables is handy and sometimes critical, it is best to avoid them as much as possible so that you don't accidentally do something like overwrite your data!  It is a __best practice__ to always try to use input and output arguements to pass information in our out of a function and let all the variables in the function be local variables.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This might be a bit confusing now, but as you continue to get experience in Python you will better understand this issue and will eventually run into cases where the use of global variables is of key importance."
