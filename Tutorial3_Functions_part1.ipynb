    "Welcome!  The goal of these tutorials is to help you get familiar with basic aspects of Python that will allow you to be more productive in everyday work.  We will work on skills that will let you graph, manipulate, and manage data.  Our goal will be to take things one step at a time, learning only what is needed to accomplish a specific task.  The philosophy behind these tutorials is learning by doing, rather than learning to let you do something later.  Hopefully you will start learning tools right from day one that will be useful in other settings.  By the end of these tutorials, you will be able to make complicated applications that load and save data to and from files, manipulate data, run numerical simulations, make complex visualizations and more! \n",

For example, consider previous tutorials where you created a graph using the ``plot()`` command.  That command is actually a function that takes your data as inputs and behind the curtain performs a large number of operations to finally output the final graph you wanted.\n",

    "All functions have three basic things in common:\n",
    "1. they have a name that you use to \"call\" them\n",
    "2. they can take some information as an input\n",
    "3. they can return some results as an output\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Function Names\n",
    "We give functions a <u>name</u> that we use to refer to, or *call*, it in our code.  For example, you saw in the example above that the Python ``log(x)`` and ``log10(x)`` functions have names that are different from the actual mathematical symbols we use. \n",

    "|---|---|---|\n",
    "|base 10 logarithm |log() | log10() | \n",
    "|natural logarithm |ln() | log() |\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to realize that functions are just names in Python and *not really* mathematical functions.  So, for example, when somebody programmed up the `log()` function that we are using, they could have just as easily called it `natural_log()` or even `banana()` and any one of those Python functions could have then ended up being the *name* we use today for calcluating a natural logarithm.  Altneratively, our hypothetical programmer could have decided to use the *function name* `log()` to calculate the base 10 logarithm - I often wonder why they didn't just use `ln()` and `log()` for the natural and base 10 logarithm respestively as it would be a lot less confusing!  Anyway, the point is that the *name* of a function in Python is just that, a name and nothing more.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Function Input Arguments\n",
    "Most functions require you to provide an input that they need to perform some customized action.  These input values are called *input arguments*.  For example, for the `log(3)` function, the input argument is the number 3.  Some functions will allow you to supply multiple input arguments.  For example, the `plot(x,y)` function allows you to submit a value, list, or array for both x and for y.  Sometimes inputs are text strings, such as for the `title()` function that allowed us to add a title to our graph.  Any information that a function will need to *\"know\"* to complete a task will need to be provided as an input.  For the most part, a function can't \"see\" the variables that you have defined unless you \"pass\" them in to the function as an input argument (though there are some exceptions to this rule we may discuss later).    \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Function Output Arguments\n",
    "Functions will also output (or *return*) a result.  For example, in the example above the `log10(1000)` returned an output value of 3, which you then assigned to the variable `z`.  A function could have more than one output.  There are several ways to deal with this, but the simplest is to just assign them to a new variable, such as in `output1, output2 = my_function(inputs)`.  It is also possible that a function might do something, but not have an output.  The `title()` function was a good example as it added a title to your graph, but didn't give you an output. \n",
