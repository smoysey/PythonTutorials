    "Welcome!  The goal of these tutorials is to help you get familiar with basic aspects of Python that will allow you to be more productive in everyday work.  We will work on skills that will let you graph, manipulate, and manage data.  Our goal will be to take things one step at a time, learning only what is needed to accomplish a specific task.  The philosophy behind these tutorials is learning by doing, rather than learning to let you do something later.  Hopefully you will start learning tools right from day one that will be useful in other settings.  By the end of these tutorials, you will be able to make complicated applications that load and save data to and from files, manipulate data, run numerical simulations, make complex visualizations and more! \n",

    "## Tutorial 2: Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial introduces the concept of variables.  Variables are just like containers that can store information.  We use different types of containers to store different kinds of materials.  For example, a basket is great for storing a picnic lunch, whereas it isn't great for holding a liquid.  In a similar way, different kinds of variables can store different kinds of information.  One of the nice things about Python compared to other programming languages is that you don't really have to worry about what type of \"container\" you need to store your information until you are ready to store it.  In other words, you can declare (or create) variables \"on the fly\" as you need them.  \n",

    "If you recall the first tutorial, we started by directly typing and manipulating numbers when we wanted to make a graph. While this is ok when you are plotting just 3 or 4 points, imagine how difficult that would be if we wanted to plot 3 or 4 THOUSAND data points!  Not so easy.  This is where variables can really make a huge difference.\n",
