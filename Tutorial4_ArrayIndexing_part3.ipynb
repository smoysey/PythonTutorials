    "Welcome!  The goal of these tutorials is to help you get familiar with basic aspects of Python that will allow you to be more productive in everyday work.  We will work on skills that will let you graph, manipulate, and manage data.  Our goal will be to take things one step at a time, learning only what is needed to accomplish a specific task.  The philosophy behind these tutorials is learning by doing, rather than learning to let you do something later.  Hopefully you will start learning tools right from day one that will be useful in other settings.  By the end of these tutorials, you will be able to make complicated applications that load and save data to and from files, manipulate data, run numerical simulations, make complex visualizations and more!
