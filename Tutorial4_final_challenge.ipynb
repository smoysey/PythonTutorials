    "# Final Challenge Problem for Tutorial 4\n",
    "For ths final challenge you will create a function that will plot a subset of data from a much larger dataset. For this challenge, you will download and work with the following data file containing a record of USGS water level (i.e., stage) observations for the Cape Fear River over the first three months of 2021:\n",

    "In this challenge, the data will come from a comma seperated variable (CSV) text file containing multiple rows of data (you can open the file and look at it on your computer before uploading to the Jupyter server).  The very first row of the file should be a header containing the names of the variables.  Each row should contain one value of x and one value of y for each observation seperated by a comma.  \n",
