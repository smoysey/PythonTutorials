    "Welcome!  The goal of these tutorials is to help you get familiar with basic aspects of Python that will allow you to be more productive in everyday work.  We will work on skills that will let you graph, manipulate, and manage data.  Our goal will be to take things one step at a time, learning only what is needed to accomplish a specific task.  The philosophy behind these tutorials is learning by doing, rather than learning to let you do something later.  Hopefully you will start learning tools right from day one that will be useful in other settings.  By the end of these tutorials, you will be able to make complicated applications that load and save data to and from files, manipulate data, run numerical simulations, make complex visualizations and more! \n",

Now if we check what type of information is stored in d, we find out that it is an array just like before.  However, when we check the data type of the first element of the array (which is the number one), we find out that it is a string, not an integer!  So in this case, Python appears to have changed all of the numbers into their text string equivalents.  We can confirm this by multiplying the first element of d by 3.  From above we can see that the value of this element is 1, so what we would expect is that 1 x 3 = 3, right?  But what we find instead is that 1 x 3 = 111!  This is because the \"1\" stored in the array is the text charcter representing the number one, not the actual mathematical number one that we can use in calculations.\n",
